# Exercises for Section 10.3

### 10.3.1
#### Answer
Skipped

### 10.3.2
#### Answer
##### a)
The topological sort used:
```
2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6
```
The critical path is
```
2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6
```
Note that there is an anti-dependence between 3 and 4.

It seems example 10.8 implies that the machine can issue an LD only
one cycle after a different LD as long as there is no dependence
between them. We are doing the same thing here.

In another word, we assume the following RT_n's
```
RT_LD (2 cycles but uses mem for 1 cycle only)
i ALU MEM
0   0   1
1   0   0

RT_(ADD/SUB)
i ALU MEM
0   1   0

RT_ST
i ALU MEM
0   0   1
```

A shortest schedule can be
```
Schedule                Reservation Table  
i Instruction           ALU        MEM
0           2             0          1
1           1             0          1
2           x             0          0        // Waiting for 1 to finish
3           3             1          0
4        5, 4             1          1
5           6             0          1
```
This schedule takes 6 cycles to finish.
##### b)
The topological sort used
```
2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6
```
The critical path is
```
2, 3, 4, 6
```
Note that 3 depends on both 1 and 2, so it takes at least 3 cycles before
3 can start.

In this case, we have a schedule similar to part a).

##### c)
Note that c) is different. 3 and 4 have no dependence between each other.

The topological sort used
```
2, 1, 4, 6, 3, 5
```

The critical paths are
```
1 -> 3 -> 5 or 2 -> 4 -> 6
```

3 depends on both 1 and 2 so it has to start after both are finished.
```
Schedule                Reservation Table  
i Instruction           ALU        MEM
0           2             0          1
1           1             0          1
2           x             0          0        // Waiting for 1 to finish
3           4             1          0
4        6, 3             1          1
5           5             0          1
```
We are not running faster due to the limitation of 1 ALU.

### 10.3.3
#### Answer
Skipped.

### 10.3.4
#### Answer
##### a)
Edges
```
1->2 1->4 1->5 (write after write)
2->5 (anti-dep)
4->5 (anti-dep)
3->6 3->4 (write after read)
5->6 5->7

```
##### b)
The critical path seem to have 5 instructions.
```
1->2->4->5->6 or 1->2->4->5->7
```

##### c)
One possible schedule
```
i Instruction
0        3, 1
1           2 (ST into R1 after 1)
2           4
3           5
4           7
5           6

```
