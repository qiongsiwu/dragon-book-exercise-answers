### 11.3.2
#### Answer
##### a)
The chart below shows the iteration space, which is a triangle.
```
(1, 3)   (1, 4)   (1, 5)   (1, 6)   (1, 7)   ...   (1, 34)   (1, 35)   (1, 36)   (1, 37)   (1, 38)
         (2, 4)   (2, 5)   (2, 6)   (2, 7)   ...   (2, 34)   (2, 35)   (2, 36)   (2, 37)
                  (3, 5)   (3, 6)   (3, 7)   ...   (3, 34)   (3, 35)   (3, 36)
                                             ...
                                           (18, 20)
```
##### b)
The iteration space is a parallelogram.
```
(10, 10)   (10, 11)   (10, 12)   ...   (10, 17)   (10, 18)   (10, 19)
           (11, 11)   (11, 12)   (11, 13)   ...   (11, 18)   (11, 19)   (11, 20)
           ...

           (1000, 1000)   (1000, 1001)   ...   (1000, 1008)   (1000, 1009)  
```
##### c)
Since k goes from i + j to 100 - i - j, the loop body is executed only if
i + j < 50.

Therefore for the two outer loops, the effective ones are the ones where
i + j < 50. Therefore the outer iteration is an upside-down triangle.
The k dimension is an upside down triangle as well, since the smaller
i + j is, the bigger range the k loops has.
